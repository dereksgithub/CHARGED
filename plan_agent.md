What We Covered:
Your Identity: Confirmed you're logged into Claude Code (username: mengyuwsl) via VSCode
Project Understanding: Thoroughly explored the CHARGED repository:
6 global cities with harmonized EV charging data
10 existing baseline models (statistical + neural + foundation models)
Comprehensive evaluation framework with 7 metrics
Your Goals Clarified:
Fine-tune foundation models (MOMENT/Chronos/Moirai)
Focus on transfer learning (data-rich → data-sparse cities)
Beat all baselines with 30-40% MAE reduction target
Your Comprehensive Plan Includes:
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Baseline benchmarking
Run all 10 existing models on priority cities
Establish performance benchmarks
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Foundation model fine-tuning
MOMENT (priority), Chronos, Moirai
Progressive unfreezing strategy
Target: 10-25% improvement
Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8): Transfer learning
Pre-train on SZH+AMS+LOA
Fine-tune on MEL/JHB/SPO
Target: 15-30% improvement over from-scratch
Phase 4 (Weeks 9-12): Advanced techniques (optional)
Multi-task learning, ensembles, federated meta-learning
